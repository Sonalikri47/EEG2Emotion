## What is EEG?

**Electroencephalography (EEG)** is a technique used to record the brain's electrical activity. EEG signals are generated by natural brain processes and are typically involuntary, making them reliable for studying brain functions such as emotions, cognitive processes, and neurological disorders. Since these signals cannot be easily controlled or hidden by an individual, they provide an accurate representation of brain activity.

## Data acquisition

EEG data captures **Subject01**'s brain activity during a **Mental Arithmetic Task (MAT)** involving serial subtraction (e.g., 3141 ‚àí 42), recorded using the Neurocom EEG 23-channel system with electrodes placed per the International 10/20 system. Since EEG acquisition is complex, requiring specialized equipment and expert handling, **an additional publicly available .edf file** was used for ease. Each channel represents neural activity from specific scalp regions, aiding in emotion prediction through cognitive analysis.

## Amplification and filtering of acquired signal

1. Amplification using **Multisim** : Electrical signals produced by the brain are in the order of micro volts. They have to be magnified so that the voltage changes can be given sufficient power to be graphically displayed.

2. Hardware implementation of amplifier circuit using **Proteus** thereby designing pcb layout, generating gerber files.
