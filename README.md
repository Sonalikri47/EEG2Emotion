# EEG2Emotion

This project focuses on developing an optimized EEG signal analysis pipeline covering data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, classification, and performance evaluation. Additionally, it includes the design of a PCB using Proteus to support hardware integration for real-time EEG signal processing.
